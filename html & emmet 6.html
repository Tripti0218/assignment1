    <p>An HTML comment is a part of the HTML code and it is used to explain the code. This can be helpful for other HTML coders when trying to interpret someone elses code. It can also be useful for yourself if you have to revisit your code in many months, or even years time. Comments aren't displayed in the browser â€” they are simply there for the programmer's benefit.

Comments can be used to introduce major sections of the code, or they can be used to explain what a small section of code does. They are also often used at the top of a document to explain things like, author, date first created, purpose of the file, provide info about related files, and more. HTML comments don't get displayed in the browser. This means that any comments you add to your HTML source code will not be shown when the document gets rendered in a web browser.</p>
