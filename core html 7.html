     <h1>programming quotes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>“Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.”</li>
        <li>“Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live”</li>
        <li>“Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.”</li>
        <li>“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.”</li>
        <li>“Truth can only be found in one place: the code.”</li>
    </ul>
